```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

cheeses <- read_csv("cheeses.csv")
head(cheeses)
class(cheeses)

cheeses <- cheeses %>%
  select(-c(url))

head(cheeses)
```

# Thoughts

We could make a phylogeny of cheeses
Map-based plots (Chris)- interactive maps
Nutrition content-based stuff: animal vs. fat content
Something with aroma and flavor- corresponding flavor with animal or region or fat-content
